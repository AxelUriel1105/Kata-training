"""A binary gap within a positive number num is any sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of num.
For example:
9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2.
529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3.
20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1.
15 has binary representation 1111 and has 0 binary gaps.
Write function gap(num) that,  given a positive num,  returns the length of its longest binary gap.
The function should return 0 if num doesn't contain a binary gap."""
def gap(num):
    return len(sorted(bin(num)[2::].strip('0').split('1'),key=lambda x: len(x))[-1])
