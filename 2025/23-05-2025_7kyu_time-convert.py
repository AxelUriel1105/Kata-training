"""This kata requires you to convert minutes (int) to hours and minutes in the format hh:mm (string).

If the input is 0 or negative value, then you should return "00:00"

Hint: use the modulo operation to solve this challenge. The modulo operation simply returns the remainder after a division. For example the remainder of 5 / 2 is 1, so 5 modulo 2 is 1.

Example
If the input is 78, then you should return "01:18", because 78 minutes converts to 1 hour and 18 minutes.

Good luck! :D"""
