"""You are given an array of non-negative integers, your task is to complete the series from 0 to the highest number in the array.

If the numbers in the sequence provided are not in order you should order them, but if a value repeats, then you must return a sequence with only one item, and the value of that item must be 0. like this:

inputs        outputs
[2,1]     ->  [0,1,2]
[1,4,4,6] ->  [0]
Notes: all numbers are positive integers.

This is set of example outputs based on the input sequence.

inputs        outputs
[0,1]   ->    [0,1]
[1,4,6] ->    [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]
[3,4,5] ->    [0,1,2,3,4,5]
[0,1,0] ->    [0]
